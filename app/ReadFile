*** Suspend: just to make functions able to stop and resume.
*** Suspend: Not responsible to do stuff in background thread.
*** Suspend: must be call from another suspend function or coroutines builder

*** Coroutines builder consist of: 1) Scope
                                   2) Starting
                                   3) thread
                                   4) body
*** Dispatchers thread is: 1) IO
                           2) Main
                           3) Default
                           4) Unconfined
                           5) newSingleThreadContext("name")
*** withContext(): to switch background thread
*** runBlocking{}: block ui
*** To make to suspend functions work in parallel ---> must use GlobalScope.

*** Launch --> no return
    Async/Await --> return
